<p>This project enhances transparency in online shopping by empowering consumers with tools to uncover hidden costs, identify dark patterns, and analyze deceptive design techniques. The solution, composed of a Chrome Extension and Web Application, addresses these issues through the following core features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hidden Cost Identifier:</strong> Exposes obscured charges during checkout.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark Pattern Highlighter:</strong> Flags manipulative design practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark Pattern Analyzer:</strong> Analyzes user interfaces to reveal deceptive patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Comparison:</strong> Enables product price comparisons across platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Chatbot:</strong> Provides real-time support to users during their shopping journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>By promoting fairness, autonomy, and informed decision-making, our tools contribute to a more transparent and ethical digital marketplace.</p>
